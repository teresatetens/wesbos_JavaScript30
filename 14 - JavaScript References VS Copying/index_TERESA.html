      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // with Objects

      console.log({ person: person, ref: person_ref, copied: person_copied });
      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
